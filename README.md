Variables related to the components can be found on the Components README

## Usage

The Role consists of two parts, each part runs independently:

**Part 1 - Components Deployment**

The task will trigger the components main roles, each role will trigger it's sub tasks (prerequisities/installation, etc.)
by default, all tasks are set to true except registration.
This process executes tasks on all hosts in parallel, reducing deployment time

*IMPORTANT: Component Registration should be always set to false in this phase

**Part 2 - Components Registration**

This task will execute the registration process of the components, all the previous tasks are set to false and only registration is enabled
This process executes the registration of each component in serial

## Inventory

Inventory consists of a group of variables:

    ---
    windows:
      children:
        pvwa:
          hosts:
            1.2.3.4;
            1.2.3.14:
            1.2.3.24:
        cpm:
          hosts:
            2.2.2.2;
            2.2.2.22;
            2.2.2.222;
        psm:
          hosts:
            9.8.7.6;
            5.4.3.2;
            9.1.7.3;
